# Astro - The SSG Framework for Building Website

We know that many JS Framework is available, like Vue, React, Svelte and so on. But many people say that they are not SEO friendly and cost many resources on Client Side. So i looked for a SSG (*Static Site Generation*) Framework for Building my GH Pages. As we know GH Pages only support static site.

I use GH Pages because of I'm a student and doesn't have much money for buying things like VPS and Domain. *So Sad* 😭

But Astro help me to build this things that can be hosted on GH Pages. yeayyy!! 👍👍👍

Astro is basically html with some improvements like JSX. It can be combined with other JS Framework as you like. Not only one Framework but you can combine all in one project, Astro also can process Markdown file and compile it to HTML like this page.

For more detailed information about Astro you can go [here](https://astro.build)

Thank's
